                             Java is one of the  most popular programming language because it is used in various
tech fields like App development , Web development , client server applications etc.

            Java is an Object Oriented programming language developed by sun microsystems of the USA in 1995.
It was originally called Oak by James Goslin.

                   He was one of the inventors of Java.

                  Java= purely Object Oriented.

How Java Works?
              * The source code in java is first compiled into the bytecode.
              * Then the java virtual machine ( JVM ) compiles the bytecode to the machine code.

                  source code (Compiled)----> byte code(Interpreted)----->machine code

Java Installation :
              JDK = Stand for Java Development kit : It is collection of tools used for developing and
                              running java programs.
        * It also contains JVM ( Java virtual machine ) and  JRE (Java runtime Environment)

             JRE = Stand for Java Runtime Environment : It helps in executing java programs.
