/*
                      **********( Basic Structure of Java Program )************

         *   Package com.company :
                                    The "Package" keyword is used to create packages in java.

                                  *  Packages are used to group the related classes.
                                  * Com.company is the name of our package.

         *    Public class Main :
                                  * In java every program must contain a class.
                                  * The filename and name of the class should be the same.
                                  * Here we have created a class named "Main".
                                  * It is the entry point to the application.

         * System.out.println(Hello World"):
                                  * This code is used to display the output on the screen.
                                  * Anything passed inside the inverted commas will show on the output.
         ******** Naming Conventions :

                                * For classes, we use Pascal Convention. The first and Subsequent characters from a
   word are capital letters (uppercase).

                    Example: Main, MyScanner, MyEmployee

  For functions and variables, we use camelCaseConvention. Here the first character is lowercase, and the subsequent
 characters are uppercase like myScanner, myMarks.
